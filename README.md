## Introduction

This project is a demo application designed to showcase the integration of our npm package,
**@viamedici-spc/configurator-ts**, with **Vue.js**.

It aims to help web developers quickly grasp how to embed and utilize **configurator-ts** in an SPA,
covering everything from initialization to user interaction and typical patterns used in configurator applications.

The app is technically designed to emphasize the features provided by our configuration solution.

## Live Demo

https://viamedici-spc.github.io/configurator-ts-demo/

The app utilizes a small _Configuration Model_ based on a simple car. It includes several _Rules_ that allow you to
explore features like _Implicit Decisions_, _Blocked Values_, and _Explain_ for different type of _Attributes_.

You can follow the workflow below to see these features in action:

1. **Select `EU` in `Sales Region`:** Your _Explicit Decision_ automatically triggers an _Implicit Decision_, where
   `Construction` is set to `Implicit: Car`. Since no further _Explicit Decision_ is required, `Construction` becomes
   _satisfied_.

2. **Select `Manual` in `Transmission::Type`:** Your _Explicit Decision_ again triggers an _Implicit Decision_, setting
   `Transmission` to `Implicit: included`.

3. **Select `yes` in `HeavyDuty`:** This action triggers the _Explain_ feature, revealing which previous selection is
   blocking `yes`.

4. **In the prompt type `1` and confirm:** This applies the first solution. The configuration system removes some of
   your incompatible
   _Explicit Decisions_ and applies additional _Implicit Decisions_.

5. **Click the _Explain_ button in the Configuration (top left):** The configuration system indicates that a _Decision_
   for `HorsePower` is required to complete the configuration.

6. **Type `300` in `HorsePower`:** The configuration is now `satisfied`, meaning you have completed the configuration.
   No _Decision_ for `Accessories` is needed as it is marked _optional_ and has been _satisfied_ from the start.
